I created an intelligent assistant that solves and explains math problems using LangChain, OpenAI, and graph-based reasoning with LangGraph.
I used:
AI-powered problem solving – answers algebra, arithmetic, and more.
Step-by-step reasoning – explains solutions, not just results to assist my learning in college rather than just showing the answer
Secure API integration – environment-based configuration with .env.
Modern tooling – managed via pyproject.toml + uv.lock.

This helped me get to grips with the integration of  OpenAI's API calling and also the use of graph based reasoning with LangGraph.
